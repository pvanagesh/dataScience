WORKSHOP ON EDA ( Dt : 2nd-Apr-23)
****************************************
-- Does my voice is clear to all.
-- I do see lot of raised hand dont worry i will answer your question at last of the session.
-- Each & every step i will mention in the notebood 
-- Non technical & technical student can understand everything,
-- I would learner to we can have Question and answer session at the end
-- EDA is very important for Data analyst, data scientist 
-- clean data to build predctive model 
-- this is not theory, hands on practicle
-- explain theory then we will go practicle 
-- 1:30 hr - 2hr
-- INTRODUCTION -->
	PRAKASH SENAPATI
	15+ yr as lead, data architect, developer, cloude, etc
	get placed walmart. 
	MICROSOFT CERTFIED
-- stay with me till last min 
-- i will addres your question at last . 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
this session is youtube live
-- you can find in the youtube 
-- visualize the data , also we can mathmaetic & staticcal understand of the data
-- excel the data visuazion explanation is limited 
-- excel read only 1048576 records 
-- organization we have db ( wipro, acce, tcs , verizon, dell )
-- data till 10l ( terabytes of the data available) organization db
-- we must need to code any programmin langaue 
-- python top most rules in the world 
-- tableau 
-- some of employee dataset
-- excel sheet = dataset ( datasceicne ) 
-- raw data -- uncleaned data ( lot of values are missing, filled with lot of noise character)
-- when ever you work any organziation you can find lot of data set whihc is raw 
-- data -- image, video, speech, text, number 
-- from raw data to clean data we use  python (jupyter)
-- we will use very import libray called PANDAS 
-- Next step we are doing as how to make uncleaned data cleaned data using help of packaged 
like ----> PANDA, NUMPY 
-- panda is the libar or package whihc we used for dataframe 
-- inbuild function & userdefi
-- data cleaning taks very very import role
-- column name == attribuetes == variable 
-- 
-- we have dataset in machine
-- we called the dataset in python program using help of PANDAS df
-- read the dataste
-- how to get dataset len, columns, info
-- how to read each & every indivial attribute we also discussed 
-- regex ( ,^%#)
build the model is not tought
data cleansing is tought
-- ds project take 1yr 
-- data cleanding it will take 4-6mont 

dataset contain numerical data & categorical data 
-- missing value treatmentt
technique behing missing value treatement
-- KNN(k-nearest neighbou)
-- if the data is numeric then we replace with mean, median, mode strategy
-- if the data is category then we repalce with mode stragety or knn method 

-- NUMPY ( pkg to take care of multidimension arrary)
-- PANDA (pkg or libary take care of dataframe)
-- DATA ANLAYST LIBRARY --> 
NUMPY & PANDA (DATA CLEANING)
- if i give th 3 recored ( math )
- if i 3cr recrods (highly impossible)
-- missing value treatment done for numerical data 

-- i said i will answe your question at last 
-- in this session base real time 
-- till now we are working on how to convert practicel raw data to clean data 

Name - category 
Domain - category
AGE - number
Location- Category
salary - number
exper - number

bydefual python give you object
try to convert object to cat & int

-- we have raw data ( unclean, filled with lot of noise chara(!#^) -- regex, replace. extrac
-- raw data we have lot of missing value and we fill the missing value with the help of .fillna
-- numeric (mean) || category ( mode)
-- change inbuild datatype to respecti data type 
-- next step i will create an excel sheet for clean data
-- so fare we generate raw data to clean data 
-- my dataset is cleaned now 
-- once the data set is clean lets visualize then 
-- m- 25, t- 30, w - 35 , thur , fride ( predictive model )
--variable identificaiton  (excel sheet == data set)
-- dataset we have columns name = variable, attribute, feature)
-- can be categorize into 2 part 
INDEPENT VARIBELE  = NON TARGET VARIABLE 
DEPENDENT VARIABLE == TARGET VARIABLE 

machine learning algorithm born from variable identification 

i.v & d.va
regression -- if dv is contriuse || classificoant -- if d.v is binary 

regression algorithm vs classification algorithm
machine leanring use case and algorithmn born from EDA (VARIABEL IDENTIFICATION)

visualization --> 

MATPLOTLIB 
SEABORN 

NUMPY || PANDA || MATPLOTLIB || SEABORN

NUMPY - multidimension array
PANDAS - dataframe
MATPLOTLIB - visualization
SEABORN -- Advanced visualization

word docuement whenever redline you will ritht click -- ignore 
 
 uni-1 || bi-2 | tri-3 || 
 UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS -- visualzie the data using 1 variable is called univariat 
 BIVARIATE ANALY -- visualzie the data using 2 variable is called bivariate 

univariaat -- uni + varaibel || bivarai== bi + variable 

distribution plot 

OUTLIER DETECTION -->
how to detect outlier --> by visualization techniq ( distplot  lm plot)
--can we visualize more then 2 variable --> heatmap 

variable transformation 
varaibel creation 

--- raw data -- clean data
- visualiet the clean data 
-- what is relavant attribte & irelave attribte
-- student pass the exam ( student heith & weightn doeesnot 
- before we build machine learning model 
-- machine is not understand 
-- split the dataset into d.v & i.v
