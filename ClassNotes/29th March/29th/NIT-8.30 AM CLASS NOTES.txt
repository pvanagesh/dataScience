python interpreter -- every line if you execute 
vs pyton compiler -- 

in the code if you have 10 line -- run at once -- compiler 
python data structrued

a = 10 ( 1 argument ) 
datatype - you can pass only 1 argument 
datastrucure - you can pass more then1 argument 

german_brand = 'bmw' ---> data type

g_brand = 'bmw', 'volk',;mer' --> data structured 

matrix --> collection of rows & columns ( table) 

organization --> database -- table, 


you are applyin job not only for indiea but for globe 


matrix -- collection of data structure 
data structure -- collection of data type 
data types -- int, float, bool, str, complex ( combination of all datatype) 

m23 -- cat + number ---> 
data cleaning (make all the attribute to proper format) --- data cleaning is very very important
before we visualization befor we build the model 
intro to raw data & clean data
-- every visualization & Model build has to build on clean data

 4- download folder --> Extract the folder --> you will recieve every day file, projects, task, class notes
 5- if you find any error take screen shot & Post that error in the classroom 
 6- if anyone view if you know the answer then please respond to your friends query
 7- do not post any other thinkg except learning ( except the class)

print("while ended")
for i in range(3,int(math.sqrt(num))+1,2):

    print(num,"%",i,"->",num//i)
    l.append(i)

why is my code skipping for loop and the code requires
if num>2:
  l.append(num)
