python interpreter -- every line if you execute 
vs pyton compiler -- 

in the code if you have 10 line -- run at once -- compiler 
python data structrued

a = 10 ( 1 argument ) 
datatype - you can pass only 1 argument 
datastrucure - you can pass more then1 argument 

german_brand = 'bmw' ---> data type

g_brand = 'bmw', 'volk',;mer' --> data structured 

matrix --> collection of rows & columns ( table) 

organization --> database -- table, 


you are applyin job not only for indiea but for globe 


matrix -- collection of data structure 
data structure -- collection of data type 
data types -- int, float, bool, str, complex ( combination of all datatype) 

m23 -- cat + number ---> 
data cleaning (make all the attribute to proper format) --- data cleaning is very very important
before we visualization befor we build the model 
intro to raw data & clean data
-- every visualization & Model build has to build on clean data

 4- download folder --> Extract the folder --> you will recieve every day file, projects, task, class notes
 5- if you find any error take screen shot & Post that error in the classroom 
 6- if anyone view if you know the answer then please respond to your friends query
 7- do not post any other thinkg except learning ( except the class)

print("while ended")
for i in range(3,int(math.sqrt(num))+1,2):

    print(num,"%",i,"->",num//i)
    l.append(i)

why is my code skipping for loop and the code requires
if num>2:
  l.append(num)

 in your organization, business -->
 identfiry relavant attributes & tryin to build the model with relavant attributes not irrelavant attributes 
 eg -- student height & weight depends on pass || fail 
 
 eveyrtiem we need to visualize the data with only only only relavant attribute 
 
 if you build the model with all attribute which is not important to the buisness then OVERFITTING problem 
 OVERFITTING -- HIGH ERROR & LESS ACCURACY 
 
 if you train the model with all the features (rel + ire) -- overfitting 
 
 -- i am going remove the user whose payment are due 
 -- CORELATION -> relation between 2 variabe ( i.v | 1 d.v) 
 -- variable identifiction 
 -- Independent variable & dependent variable 
 -- relavant attribute & irrelavant attribute
 -- build the model or graphs with rel 
 -- dv is continute -- regression algo || dv is binary -- classification 
 ---- range of the corelation is -1 to 1 
 -- -1 to 0 ==> strongly -ve corelation 
 -- 0 ==> no corelation 
 -- 0-1 ==> strongly +ve coreation
